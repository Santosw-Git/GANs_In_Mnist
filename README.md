# GANs_In_Mnist
This project trains a GAN on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digits. It uses a generator-discriminator setup, Binary Cross-Entropy loss, and the Adam optimizer. Generated digit samples are saved for visualization, showcasing progressive improvements across epochs.
